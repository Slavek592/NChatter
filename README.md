# NChatter

## Explanation

This is an NChatter chatting application made by Viacheslav Nikiforov.
In this school project I have made the server part (in C#) with it's database (SQLite) and the console client (in Python).
It worked for sending text messages on one computer, when tested.

## Use

It was my school project and the project has ended, so I won't add anything here.
If You want to use it, or create something based on it, feel free. I will be happy to know, that it was at least a bit useful.
Note: In case of using, change the path to the database to Your path (it's in the code).
